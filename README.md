# Decksterity

Decksterity is a free and open source PowerPoint add-in that aims to replicate core consulting toolbar elements, 
inspired by add-ins like [Instrumenta](https://github.com/iappyx/Instrumenta) or [Design Toolbars](https://designtoolbars.com). While Decksterity is more limited than both of these options, it includes the elements and alignment tools that I most frequently leverage conveniently centralized to one ribbon tab with familiar, easily learned hotkeys (which will be most familiar to Bain Toolbox users). 

Decksterity works best when combined with [**think-cell**](https://www.think-cell.com/en) to provide key missing consulting toolbox functionality - e.g., charts and graphs, agenda slides, chevrons, save/send slides, and much more. Additionally, Decksterity will be more useful if you invest in creating a [PowerPoint template](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-and-save-a-powerpoint-template-ee4429ad-2a74-4100-82f7-50f8169c8aca) and [think-cell style file](https://www.think-cell.com/en/resources/manual/customization) suited to your needs.

### Keyboard shorcuts

- **Access keys (alt shortcuts)**: Each function is tagged to access keys that will be most familiar to Bain Toolbox users - e.g., `Alt-X-AL` for aligning left; in order to keep this one tab, primary aligns will fall into the same first-level access key (e.g., `Alt-P-AL` from Bain Toolbox becomes `Alt-X-PAL`)
- **Control keys**: Decksterity provides the same control hotkeys (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+1` to align left) as the Bain Toolbox
